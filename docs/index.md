PopIt is an easy-to-install web service for storing and sharing the names and career histories of public figures like politicians and celebrities. We built it to save time and save pain for anyone building a website that is built on top of a list of people, whether a politician-watching site or a celeb-spotting one.

## Key features

* Lightweight, quick and easy to understand
* Data structure built on learning from our mistakes - so you don't have to
* Supports websites written in any language - uses REST
* Interfaces for adding data by hand, or via import
