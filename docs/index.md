PopIt is a web service for storing and sharing the names and career histories of public figures like politicians or celebrities. We built it to save time and save pain for anyone building a website that is built on top of a list of people, whether a politician-watching site or a celeb-spotting one.

## Key features

* Lightweight, quick and easy to understand
* Data structure built on learning from our mistakes - so you don't have to
* Supports websites written in any language - uses REST
* Interfaces for adding data by hand, or via import

## Get in touch

You can contact at us at any of the following:

  * The [Poplus mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus) for general discussion about PopIt and other similar components.
  * Chat on the [#popit IRC channel](irc://irc.mysociety.org/popit) on `irc.mysociety.org`.
