We hope that PopIt is quite easy to install and get running. If you have any issues please let us know at popit@mysociety.org or by reporting it on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/mysociety/popit/issues).

## Just want a PopIt site?

We run a free [PopIt hosting service](http://popit.mysociety.org/) - if you just want to create a site to put data in that might be a better option. If you want to run your own, or contribute to the code then read on!

## Platforms

There are specific install instructions for some platforms:

  * [MacOS X](macos)
  * [Ubuntu](ubuntu)
  * [Vagrant](vagrant)

## Configuration

See the [configuration notes](/docs/install/configuration).

## Developers

In addition to these notes please see 'Developer Setup' section in the file `docs/contributing.md` if you want to work on the code.
