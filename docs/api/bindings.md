There are libraries available that make the API easy to use in the following languages:

  * **PHP:**    [https://github.com/mysociety/popit-php](https://github.com/mysociety/popit-php)
  * **Python:** [https://github.com/mysociety/popit-python](https://github.com/mysociety/popit-python)
  * **Ruby:**   [https://github.com/opennorth/popit-ruby](https://github.com/opennorth/popit-ruby)
  
The API is REST based and simple to use. For other languages [contributions](/docs/codebase/contributing) are very welcome.
