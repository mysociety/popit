  <h2>Nearly Done! Now check your email...</h2>
  
  <p> 
    The confirmation email <strong>may</strong> take a few minutes to arrive 
    &mdash; <em>please</em> be patient.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you use web-based email or have 'junk mail' filters, you may wish to   
    check your bulk/spam mail folders: sometimes, our messages are marked 
    that way.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You must now click on the link within the email we've just sent you 
    - if you do not we won't create your site.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (Don't worry - we'll wait while you're checking your email.)
