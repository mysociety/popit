<h1>Host your own PopIt site</h1>

<p>
  We'll host your site for you, for free - but if you want to run your own
  site then you can do that too.
</p>

<p>
  You might want your own site if your users are not near the UK (where our
  servers are based). Or you might want to access the database directly,
  rather than using the API.
</p>

<p>
  The PopIt code is open source and available to download from the
  <a href="https://github.com/mysociety/popit">GitHub PopIt repository</a>.
  There you will find instructions on installing and running the site.
</p>

<p>
  If you already have a site hosted on our servers and want to run it on
  yours let us know and we'll arrange to transfer the database and image
  files to you.
