  <p>
    Creation of new sites is currently disabled. We're making some fairly big
    changes to the codebase and don't want people to have the site break under
    them.
  </p>

  <p>
    These changes will include making the API much simpler and switching it to
    use the <a href="http://popoloproject.com/">Popolo standard</a> for data
    validation. We'll also be making it much easier to use PopIt in your own
    website by providing code for use in frameworks like Django.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want to be informed when we re-enable site creation please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1__n1UhDjF7Tk_UIF5gx0XmTEtSbmNYS7a1t-DyU5ggA/viewform">give us
    your email address</a>.
