<h1>Data Import</h1>

<p>
  PopIt will let you enter and access data easily from your code. It will 
  also let you upload existing data to quickly populate a new site.
</p>


<h2>Migration Tool</h2>

<p> 
  If you have been collecting information on people in a spreadsheet, this 
  web based tool will let you quickly upload it all into PopIt rather than 
  entering it manually.
</p>

<p>
  To use it, simply go to <code>/migration</code> in your PopIt instance and 
  follow the instructions. 
</p>


<h2>API</h2>

<p> 
  The API will let you access and modify all the data in PopIt, as well as 
  storing your own custom data. Please see <a href="http://popit.mysociety.org/docs/api/">the API docs</a>
  for more details.
</p>

<p> 
  We use the API from the editing interface on the website to be sure that 
  all interactions with PopIt can be achieved through the API. It is not an 
  afterthought - it is a core piece of the site.
</p>

<p>
  Improving the API is an ongoing task with several <a href="https://github.com/mysociety/popit/issues?labels=API&amp;milestone=&amp;page=1&amp;state=open">open issues</a>. If you have particular suggestions or questions please let us know on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus">poplus mailing list</a>.
