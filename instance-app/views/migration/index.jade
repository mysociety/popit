    h1 Migration Tool

  p 
    | If you have been collecting information on people in a spreadsheet this 
    | will let you quickly upload it all into PopIt rather than manually 
    | entering it in. We expect that this will be in the form of a 
    a(href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values", title="Wikipedia article on the file format") CSV
    |  file.

  p The migration tool is intended to add data to PopIt, not to import data after the first import.

  p The migration process consists of 3 steps. 
  ol
    li Upload a CSV file
    li Define the mapping
    li Wait for the import to happen

  if migration.length
    a(href="/migration/clear") Clear previous migrations
    ul
      for single in migration
        li
          a(href="/migration/mapping/#{ single.id }") #{ single.source.name } 
            small (#{ single.created })

  form(method="post", action="/migration/upload", enctype="multipart/form-data")
    #migration_source_file
      label Source file
      input(type="file", name="source", value="")
      //if error != ''
      //  span.error #{error}

    input(type="submit", class="btn", value="Upload your CSV")
